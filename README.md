Food Finder
=================
## Inspiration
We wanted to gather real time data for foodbanks and organize it in an accesible and digital way for folks who need it.

## What it does
Food Finder allows Foodbanks to input how much food is available at certain sites so people can easily find food when they need it, all from the
accessability of a phone or pc.

## How we built it
We used Django for the backend, HTML and CSS for the frontend and Glitch for collaborativly editing and hosting on the cloud.
